                <h4>How Revature Fills the Gap Between College and Top Technology Careers</h4>
                <sect>
                    <p>Today, coding has become the holy grail of employability skills. But according to Joe Vacca,
                        Chief Marketing Officer at Revature, the path to a successful career in technology is much
                        more complex than mastering a few coding languages.</p>
                    <p>“CIOs, really, as they look at their organization, and look at emerging talent, think ‘OK the
                        struggles there are really soft skills and business acumen.’ Software developers, engineers,
                        the technology teams are constantly engaging with the rest of the company. So your ability
                        to communicate and articulate what you’re doing and analyze requirements is very important.”

                    <h4>A coding school where college grads train and work without spending a dime</h4>
                    <section>
                        <p>Right around this time last year, Edward Young was donning a cap and gown for graduation
                            at St. John’s University in New York. He figured his bachelor’s degree in computer
                            science
                            would open doors to all sorts of tech jobs, but a few rounds of interviews proved
                            otherwise.</p>
                        <p> Scrolling through an employment website months later, Young stumbled across a listing
                            for Revature, a Northern Virginia company offering 12 weeks of computer programming
                            classes. Instead
                            of asking students to hand over upward of $10,000 — the going rate for similar “coding
                            boot camps”
                            — Revature pays them minimum wage during the training. And upon graduation, the company
                            sends its software engineers out on two-year assignments at federal agencies and banks
                            and other
                            corporations.

                    <h4>Shared Vision, Key to Investcorp Acquisition of Revature</h4>
                    <p>Revature, a leading technology talent development company, announced that Investcorp, a
                        leading global provider and manager of alternative investment products, has acquired a
                        controlling interest in the company. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed.</p>
                    <p>Revature's recent growth has been significant and the Investcorp acquisition positions the
                        company for major expansion over the next few years. The two companies have a shared vision of
                        how a disruptive talent development model can have a major impact on technology teams around the
                        globe.
